# First-website
Creating a website from scratch using HTML, CSS and Flexbox.

Noticed an error when shrinking the window with neon lights, probably should've worked with background-image instead of adding an image and playing with absolute-relative positions.
Mistake to learn from, if in future I know a better way to solve I may fix it, otherwise I won't, in the end is just the first web I've created :).
